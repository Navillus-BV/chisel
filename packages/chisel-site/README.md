# Eleventy Skeleton

Inspired by [Possibly the Easiest Way to Run An SSG](https://css-tricks.com/possibly-the-easiest-way-to-run-an-ssg/).

No dependencies. No plugins. No preprocessors. Just make a static website.

Out of the box Netlify deploys. Includes mini CSS reset by Eric Meyer.

## Commands

These commands assume you're in a unix environment, but they should work anywhere `npx`/`npm` is available.

### Develop

```sh
$ npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

### Build

```sh
$ npx @11ty/eleventy
```

## Netlify

First, enable your Eleventy Skeleton repo on Netlify's interface.

When prompted, clear the `build` and `publish` fields (that's what your `netlify.toml` is for). Then set your deploy branch (e.g., `main`).

Now each time you push to your deploy branch you'll also deploy your most recent changes. ðŸŽ‰
